GIT FUNDAMENTALS

git push --set-upstream origin namegoeshere
# assigns upstream to branch as opposed to master

git clone URLgoeshere localdestinationgoeshere

git remote -v
# states what URLs you can push to (starts with origin)

git remote add upstream MAIN(beforefork)URLHERE

# but then you could push to the main branch instead of your fork which could be bad (might not have permission)
# so you'll want to switch that off

git remote set-url --push URLGOESHERE
